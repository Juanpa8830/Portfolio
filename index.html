            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> <span> Hello! My name is Juan Pablo Guerrero Ríos </span> I'm a full-stack development student currently
                enrolled
                in a remote software development school called Microverse that uses pair programming and real-world
                projects to teach development. </p>

            <br>

            <p> I've spent the last several months completely immersed in remote development, building everything
                from landing pages to Rails APIs. During this process, I have developed extensive
                knowledge in the next stacks: </p>

            <br>

            <p> - Front-end development: JavaScript |React.js | Redux-Redux Toolkit| CSS3 | HTML5.</p>

            <p> - Back-end development: Ruby | Rails | PostgreSQL </p>

            <p> - Tools & Methods: Git, GitHub, Render, Mobile/Responsive Development, RSpec, TDD, Chrome Dev Tools.
            </p>

            <p> - Professional: Remote Pair-Programming, Teamwork, Mentoring, Leadership.</p>

            <br>
            <p>
                As a petroleum engineer, I worked in the Colombian oil industry for two years where I learned
                several of the skills I now use every day as a developer: problem-solving, effective communication,
                multi-tasking, and more. I regularly won employee awards, and I now bring the same kind of energy to
                all of my work, including my growth as a software engineer." I also lived in Australia for several
                months, where I spent plenty of days working with a diverse population of people in a stressful,
                fast-paced environment, so I was already a pro at juggling the empathy, communication, and work
                ethic, needed to succeed in the dev world.

                        <p>I have a sizable portfolio of over 46 projects, all of which were developed using different
                            technology stacks like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React/Redux, and Ruby on Rails. The Cozy
                            Homes API, a Ruby-based back-end project with a simple UI and thorough rental history, is
                            one of my most notable projects. The user-friendly React UI of Cozy Homes compliments the
                            API and makes renting a home simple.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Additionally, I created the My-Budget App, a dynamic and user-friendly spending monitoring
                            program. Users may track
                            spending, synchronize data between devices, and create custom categories for tracking that
                            is more relevant to them.
                            Both the front end and the back end of this project used Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL was
                            used for best

                            and research space flight. Users can book rockets on this innovative website and take part

                        <p>"Leaderboard" is an application that allows user to register user names and their respective
                            scores. These scores are displayed after getting the data from an API. I developed this

                        <p>This is a WebApp that shows three pages: home, calculator and quote. Each one of the pages
                            displays some
                            information. Furthermore, the Calculator page displays a functional calculator that is free
                            and easy to use
                            by users. I developed this project with HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript,
